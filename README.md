# EMSIM
Exersises in computational electromagnetics. Based on the book computation electromagnetics from Springer. 

# Introduction
Simple simulation programs to try out different simulation methods.
Currently finite descrite time domain (FDTD) is implemented for a siumple eignen mode simulation. Plan to include FEM in the future for simple STL type structures. THis will either again be an eigen mode type simulation or I may add ports and make a simple S-parameter simulator. 

# Update 23/11
Adding a new method of moments simulator. Starting from scratch with python and numpy, intend to use the BLAS and LAPACK functions in num py and scipy.
