# EMSIM
Exersises in computational electromagnetics. Eventually I would like to hook this into FreeCads FEM work bench. Or at least use elements from it such as the mesh generator to create a new open source EM simulation enviornment to do simple things like antennas, simple PCB simualtions, radar cross section. I suspect this will take a long time. 


# Introduction
Simple simulation programs to try out different simulation methods.
Currently finite descrite time domain (FDTD) is implemented for a siumple eignen mode simulation. Plan to include FEM in the future for simple STL type structures. THis will either again be an eigen mode type simulation or I may add ports and make a simple S-parameter simulator. 

# Update 23/11
Adding a new method of moments simulator. Starting from scratch with python and numpy, intend to use the BLAS and LAPACK functions in num py and scipy.
